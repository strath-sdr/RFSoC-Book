    "## 05 - FEC Bit Error Analysis\n",
    "This is the fifth and final notebook exploring Soft Decision Forward Error Correction (SD-FEC) on RFSoC. In previous notebooks, we have learned how to use the SD-FEC integrated blocks on the RFSoC device to perform LDPC encoding and decoding. In addition to this, we have investigated a simplified radio pipeline that performs baseband modulation, and demodulation into soft bits after being subjected to an AWGN channel. The performance measure, BER, was introduced which provides insight into how a code performs for a given SNR in terms of bit errors. In this notebook we will bring all these components together to make multiple measurements of BER and plot BER curves which is a useful analytical tool when assessing and comparing code performance. \n",

    "## 1. Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"nb5_introduction\"></a>\n",
    "In this notebook we will be generating BER curves to compare the performance of the LDPC codes: DOCSIS Short, DOCSIS Medium, and DOCSIS Long. By utilising the *bypass* functionality of the SD-FEC cores, we can additionally plot a BER curve for when no error correction code is in use; this will be referred to as *uncoded*. The first section of this notebook will use the same process that has been employed in the previous notebooks to obtain BER values. However, because only the encoding and decoding is performed on the programmable logic (PL) and a significant amount of processing is undergone in the processing system (PS), it will be demonstrated that this leads to very long execution times and is therefore not feasible for generating BER curves with good resolution on the x-axis and accuracy on the y-axis. Therefore, in the section two, a second design will be presented where all of the processing has been moved to the programmable logic and Jupyter is only used for control and visualisation. This results in decreased execution times. When processing is moved from the PS to the PL to decrease execution times, this is referred to as hardware acceleration. The same principals that have been explored thus far are still applicable. The companion book for these notebooks, *\"Software Defined Radio with Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC\"*, provides more detail on designing a simplified radio pipeline in hardware and interfacing this with the SD-FEC integrated blocks on RFSoC. \n",

    "We want to be able to change between LDPC codes easily. As we know from previous notebooks, each code will require a different size of data buffer. Therefore, upon specifying a code, we must also allocate our tx and rx buffers for both our encoder and decoder. To change the code employed by the SD-FEC blocks, we supply a control word which indicates the code ID associated with the code. In the function below, we create the necessary control words for the SD-FEC blocks and allocate our data buffer sizes. At the top of the function, you might notice something that has not been presented before - CORE_BYPASS. This bypass functionality, when active, simply means that the SD-FEC core outputs the same data that is input to it. This allows us to obtain BER measurements for when no error correction is performed. The code name is changed in this circumstance to *docsis_medium* so that the data buffers are configured with this code’s required size, as it provides a good trade-off between speed and accuracy as you will see when generating the BER plots. The data buffers are returned by this function so that they can be used in the other functions that follow.\n"

    "As you may have noticed, collecting all of the BER measurements can take a considerable amount of time. Additionally, the resolution of the plots is low, as we only recorded a BER measurement at 1 dB SNR increments. The accuracy of the measured results may also be low, which is particularly evident in the case of DOCSIS Short. This is due to the fact that we are measuring over a smaller number of bits. While increasing the number of blocks transferred for each SNR value will lead to better results, it will also increase execution time. The current architecture was designed to be educational and builds much of the pipeline from first principles in Python. However, in the following section, we will introduce a new architecture that moves the entire pipeline to the RFSoC's programmable logic, significantly improving execution times.\n",

    "As can be observed from the figure, the overall pipeline remains unchanged, however, there are some variations in how data is transferred between the PS and PL, as well as how the control and status words are written to and read from the SD-FEC cores. Instead of moving large blocks of data between the PS and PL, data is generated in the PL, and only control words and the BER measurement are transferred. This eliminates the need for using DMAs, as data movement can instead be accomplished using the AXI-Lite protocol. As a result, there is no requirement to create data buffers of a specific size each time the LDPC code is changed. Reducing the movement of large data blocks between the PS and PL greatly reduces the overall execution time. The control and status words required for the SD-FEC core are now handled by a custom IP, called *SD-FEC Controller*, which again removes any DMA provision. Control words are supplied to a memory-mapped address on the *SD-FEC Controller* IP core, and the core communicates the control word over AXI4-Stream to the SD-FEC core at the required rate dictated by the block size. Another important thing to note is that the *BER Calculation* block outputs an interrupt. This signals that the BER measurement has completed.\n",

We can also increment the SNR value by a smaller amount, improving the x-axis resolution. In the cell below we transfer 10000 blocks of data and vary the SNR by 0.2 dB, meaning for each curve we are measuring over 50000 times as many bits as were measured over for the same code in the previous implementation. The cell should take approximately 2 minutes to execute meaning despite the increased number of blocks, our execution time is actually lower. "

    "In this final notebook, we have brought all the concepts and techniques covered in previous notebooks together to generate BER curves and compare the performance of different LDPC codes. We have explored the process of generating BER curves using both a PS-based and a PL-based design, and highlighted the benefits of using hardware acceleration to improve execution times. Overall, this series has provided a comprehensive overview of how to utilise the SD-FEC core on RFSoC for performing LDPC coding and decoding and analyzing the performance of different codes. By the end of this series, readers should have a solid understanding of how to implement SD-FEC on RFSoC, and be equipped with the necessary knowledge to explore and experiment with different codes and configurations."
